Reasons for building a PC 

1. Customization
When building your own computer, you have complete control over the components, from the CPU and GPU to the storage and case design. 
This allows you to tailor the system specifically for your needs, whether for gaming, graphic design, programming, or general use. Custom builds also provide flexibility in selecting components that 
align with your budget and future upgrade plans.

2. Cost Efficiency
Pre-built computers often come with extra costs associated with branding and labor. Building your own system allows you to choose components that offer the best price-to-performance ratio, 
often resulting in a more powerful machine for less money. Additionally, you can decide where to allocate more budget, such as focusing on a high-performance GPU or saving on less crucial parts like the case.

3. Enhanced Learning Experience
The process of assembling a computer offers hands-on experience with hardware, which is invaluable for anyone interested in technology. 
It helps users understand how different components work together, including how to troubleshoot problems, manage cooling solutions, and optimize performance. 
This knowledge can be especially beneficial for students studying computer science or IT fields.

4. Better Performance
Building your own computer allows you to choose high-performance parts that meet your specific needs. 
For tasks like gaming, video editing, or running demanding applications, this can result in a faster, more efficient machine compared to many pre-built options. 
Overclocking is also easier with custom builds, providing even more performance tuning options.
