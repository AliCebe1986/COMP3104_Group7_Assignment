  There are some Canadian taxes that i'd like to address it;

#Income Tax:
 -) Progressive Tax System: Canada uses a progressive tax system where the tax rate increases as income increases.
This means higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.
 -) Federal and Provincial Rates: Both the federal government and provincial/territorial governments levy 
income taxes. The combined rates can vary significantly depending on the province or territory.

#Goods and Services Tax (GST):
  -) Standard Rate: The GST is a value-added tax levied by the federal government at a standard rate of 5% on most goods and services.
  -) Harmonized Sales Tax (HST): Some provinces combine their provincial sales tax with the GST to create the HST, 
which can range from 13% to 15% depending on the province.
