  There are some Canadian taxes that i'd like to address it;

#Income Tax:
 -) Progressive Tax System: Canada uses a progressive tax system where the tax rate increases as income increases.
This means higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.
 -) Federal and Provincial Rates: Both the federal government and provincial/territorial governments levy 
income taxes. The combined rates can vary significantly depending on the province or territory.

#Goods and Services Tax (GST):
  -) Standard Rate: The GST is a value-added tax levied by the federal government at a standard rate of 5% on most goods and services.
  -) Harmonized Sales Tax (HST): Some provinces combine their provincial sales tax with the GST to create the HST, 
which can range from 13% to 15% depending on the province.

#Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Contributions:
  -) Mandatory Contributions: Employees and employers must contribute to the CPP, which provides retirement, disability,
and survivor benefits. The contribution rate for 2023 is 5.95% for employees and employers, and 11.9% for self-employed individuals.

#Property Tax:
  -) Municipal Tax: Property taxes are levied by municipalities and are based on the assessed value of the property.
These taxes fund local services such as schools, infrastructure, and public safety.
