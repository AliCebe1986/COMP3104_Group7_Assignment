There are some importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle:

1) Faster Delivery and Deployment: DevOps practices like Continuous 
Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) automate testing and 
deployment, leading to quicker release cycles and more reliable software.

2) Improved Quality and Reliability: Automated testing and monitoring 
ensure that code is thoroughly tested before deployment, reducing the 
likelihood of bugs and errors.
