Tennis - Main Rules:
1. The game is played either as singles (1 vs. 1) or doubles (2 vs. 2).
2. The objective is to hit the ball over the net into the opponent's side of the court.
3. A point starts with a serve, alternating between players.
4. Scoring goes: 15, 30, 40, and then game point.
   - If both players reach 40, itâ€™s called a "deuce." A player must win two consecutive points to win the game.
5. A set is won by the first player to win 6 games with at least a 2-game margin. If the set reaches 6-6, a tiebreaker is played.
6. A match is usually best of 3 or best of 5 sets.
7. The ball must land within the designated court areas for a point to count.
8. If the ball hits the net but lands in the correct area during a serve, it's called a "let" and the serve is retaken.
Tennis - Additional Rules:
Double fault: If a player fails to make a legal serve in two consecutive attempts, they lose the point
